## Data-Fountain
Data-Fountain is project funded by an educational grant and its aim is to represent meteorological (MET) and oceanographic (Ocean) data from buoys and weather stations in a way that is easy to interpret by middle and high school students.

The site will collect and store, at regular intervals, MET and Ocean data.  This data will be represented by various graphs and icons and put on display via Television screens located around the school through a Google Chrome HDMI streaming video adapter.


<b>OCEAN Data Source</b>
Oceanographic data will be provided by NDBC stations, harvested at ASA. Data Access will be provided via Oceansmap.

<b>MET (METAR for weather) Source</b>
For the Chesapeake area there is one METAR station available (KTGI), this will provide meteorological data (weather conditions, windspeed, direction) for station and weather icons in the banner. Data Access will be provided via Oceansmap.

<b>TIDAL Data source</b>
Tidal data will be provided by USGS stations, harvested at ASA. Data Access will be provided via Oceansmap.

<b>Lunar Data Source</b>
* Suncalc for moon illumination

### JavaScript Coding Styles

- Write [standard](http://npm.im/standard) JavaScript style.
- Files should NOT end with new line, because we want to match Googleâ€™s styles.
- File names should be concatenated with - instead of _ , e.g. file-name.js rather than file_name.js, because in [github/atom](https://github.com/github/atom) module names are usually in the module-name form.
- Use newer ES6 syntax where appropriate
	- const for requires and other constants
	- let for defining variables
	- [Arrow functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions) instead of function () { }
	- [Template literals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals) instead of string concatenation using +
